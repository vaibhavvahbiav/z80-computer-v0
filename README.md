Z80 8-bit computer design (For educational purposes only)

The main motive for making this computer design was pure intrigue in retro computers, working of computers and overall interest in computational electronics.

I chose Z80 specifically, because it is one of the greatest 8 bit CPUs / microprocessors ever made. It can be compared to the great 6502.

Z80 is also an easier to understand microprocessor and is easily available across the world at affordable prices.
This Design is a student project, for the students. This design was the first iteration of the design I am trying to achieve. It is completely messy.
But i will be constantly try to make this is a better piece of hardware.
This project has many problems and scopes of improvements which are highlighted in the mistakes and scopes of improvement file.


When I started working on this project, I started learning about the various delays, clock signals, control signals and how does z80 computes, stores and outputs.
This helped me learn about how computers work in a broader sense, as it created a basic idea about it.

The Zilog Z80 is a 8 bit microprocessor which can operate from 4MHz to 20MHz (Much higher in newer versions).
It is slow enough to make students understand the working, while fast enough to be considered a Consumer computer.

The build here uses 8Kb of ROM, 8Kb of RAM, a PPI (Parallel Peripheral Interface) with 3 ports for external I/O devices like keyboards and a latch to display a output in LEDs(didnt want to use Display as it increased complexities).

The PCB was the first attempt at doing work at Computational electronics stuff, as it shows that nothing is structured and everything is just like cooper noodles on a plate.

This publication is an attempt to get feedback from everyone regarding improvements, and changes that are required to make the build better so that i can create a much better piece of hardware.
