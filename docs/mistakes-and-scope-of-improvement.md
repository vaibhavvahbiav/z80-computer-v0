Mistakes and Scope of Improvements 
1) The IC placement is not good, the traces are hard to path.
2) The Traces should be more understandable rather than looking like spaghetti.
3) The instead of the routes being direct, they take the long route which is not good at all.
4) Address-Decoding ICs are not Decoding they are just going rogue.
5) Power supply lines are not perfect, Decoupling caps are just exiting without fulfilling any purpose.
6) the reset circuit is messed up and doesnt make any sense.
7) Everything is just too crowded, which makes it harder to decode and understand which is the main purpose of this computer.
8) I went towards aesthetics too early, made it too many things at once.
   Will try to rectify the problems in the next iteration.
